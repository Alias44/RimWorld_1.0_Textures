# RimWorld_1.Textures
A more organized collection of textures for the 1.0 version of Ludeon Studios' Rimworld. All content belongs solely to Ludeon Studios and will be removed if requested

Note: textures have been sorted using a combination of the in game graphics database, the core xml files, and some very sketchy regex's, so if something is wrong or missing let me know and I'll fix it.
