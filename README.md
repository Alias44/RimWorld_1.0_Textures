# RimWorld_1.0_Unstable-Textures
A more organized collection of textures for the unstable 1.0 version of Ludeon Studios' Rimworld All content belongs solely to Ludeon Studios and will be removed if requested

Note: Not all textures are propperly sorted, I am waiting for the stable version to dig through the xml's for propper sorting of new and changed items
